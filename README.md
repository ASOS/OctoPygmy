# OctoPygmy

A small Chrome extension for Octopus Deploy to provide some additional functions to the user interface.

##### Currently working
 - Dashboard project collapser
 - [Environment collapser]

##### Todo (not exhaustive list just some I like on the UserVoice site)
 - [Update step template across all projects]
 - Projects collapser (just the projects page, dashboard already done)
 - [Filter machines by role or name]
